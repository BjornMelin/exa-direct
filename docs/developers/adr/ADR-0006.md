# ADR-0006: Endpoint Coverage Scope

**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Drivers:** End-to-end workflows; parity with Exa docs.

## Context
We need all core endpoints to deliver complete research and coding flows.

## Decision
Implement Search, Contents, Find Similar, Answer, Research (Create/Get/List + Poll + SSE), and Context in v1 CLI.

### Decision Framework Scoring
| Option                       | Coverage | Latency | Ergonomics | Invocability | Maintenance | Extensibility | Weighted |
|------------------------------|----------|---------|------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Full coverage (FINAL)**    | 10       | 9       | 9          | 9            | 9           | 9             | 9.25     |
| Minimal subset               | 6        | 9       | 8          | 9            | 10          | 7             | 7.95     |

## Consequences
Comprehensive features; slightly more code with small maintenance impact.

## Alternatives Considered
Minimal subset; inadequate for research/Context flows.

## Implementation Notes
1:1 mapping between subcommands and endpoints; JSON stdout.

## References
